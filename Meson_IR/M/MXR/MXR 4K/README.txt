The normal volume function in my file is mapped to the TV VOL- and TV VOL+ buttons, but you can remap this for your needs of course.

The reason for the remapping is that when I press the blue VOL+ button on my box, even when not mapped to any command, the box instantly shuts down.

I am unsure if this happens only with my box or if all these boxes are like this on libreelec?

I hope it helps anyone,
